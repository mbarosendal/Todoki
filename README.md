[10-20-2025 Update] - Pending Migration to new host

# [**Live Demo**](https://todoki.up.railway.app/)  

## Overview  

Todoki is a **Pomodoro timer with task management features**, built as a summer project to challenge myself to create something I would use myself.  

The name **Todoki** comes from a play on words:  
- **Todo** (a to-do list, tasks)  
- **Ki / 気** (Japanese for *spirit*, *energy*, or *focus*)  

Together, it reflects the idea of focusing your energy on tasks.  

I am an avid user of Pomodoro timers, and this project gave me the chance to explore full-stack development while experimenting with clean architecture and UX patterns. I am still learning, and there is still a lot of room for improvement.

If you’re new to the Pomodoro technique, you can read more about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique).

## About This Repository  

This repo is not intended to be a production-ready project.
It is a **public fork/scrape** of the codebase that powers the running web app, mainly to share my approach to building a Pomodoro timer in code.

The hosted site is actively evolving as a personal tool and a learning project, so expect some instability.
