[**Live Demo**](https://todoki-a5chhfeqgwcwfab2.swedencentral-01.azurewebsites.net/)  

## Overview  

Todoki is a **Pomodoro timer with task management features**, built as a summer project to challenge myself to create something I would use myself.  

The name **Todoki** comes from a play on words:  
- **Todo** (a to-do list, tasks)  
- **Ki / 気** (Japanese for *spirit*, *energy*, or *focus*)  

Together, it reflects the idea of focusing your energy on tasks.  

I am an avid user of Pomodoro timers, and this project gave me the chance to explore full-stack development while experimenting with clean architecture and UX patterns.  

If you’re new to the Pomodoro technique, you can read more about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique).

- Designing and maintaining a clean architecture  
- Deploying and maintaining a small hosted web app

## About This Repository  

This repo is not intended to be a production-ready project.
It is a **public fork/scrape** of the codebase that powers the running web app, mainly to share my approach to building a Pomodoro timer in code.

The hosted site is actively evolving as a personal tool and a learning project, so expect some instability.

## Roadmap  

- [ ] Polish UI and UX  
- [ ] Improve error handling and resilience
- [ ] Add features to help users stay focused on the current task  
- [ ] Implement task scheduling for recurring tasks
- [ ] Add more customization options
